# E-Mail Signature

### Customized e-mail signature made with pure HTML.

Should be responsive and fully functional in all e-mail clients (tested on Thunder/Betterbird, GMail, Outlook and Apple Mail).

Displays my name as a title and four icons as direct links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, Behance and Whatsapp pages.

This was a great way to learn how tables, centering and alignment works in HTML, since I wasn't able to use flexboxes due to e-mail limitations.
